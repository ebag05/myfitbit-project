        <p>In New York City, obesity is epidemic: more than half of adult New Yorkers are overweight (34%) or obese (22%).  Data show that obesity begins early in life: nearly half of all elementary school children and Head Start children are not a healthy weight.  In New York City, 1 in 5 kindergarten students, and 1 in 4 Head Start children, is obese.

        People (adults and children) who are overweight are at increased risk for diabetes heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis, and cancer.</p>

        <p>Obesity is one of the most pervasive, chronic diseases in need of new strategies for medical treatment and prevention. As a leading cause of United States mortality, morbidity, disability, healthcare utilization and healthcare costs, the high prevalence of obesity continues to strain the United States healthcare system.
 
        <p>Obesity is defined as excess adipose tissue. There are several different methods for determining excess adipose (fat) tissue; the most common being the Body Mass Index (BMI) (see below). A fat cell is an endocrine cell and adipose tissue is an endocrine organ. As such, adipose tissue secretes a number of products, including metabolites, cytokines, lipids, and coagulation factors among others. Significantly, excess adiposity or obesity causes increased levels of circulating fatty acids and inflammation. This can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn can lead to type 2 diabetes.</p>

        <p>The biology of food intake is very complex, involving olfaction (smell), taste, texture, temperature, cognitive and emotional responses and metabolic/autonomic information, which signal the brain to initiate or cease eating. Recent scientific studies have identified several substances that act on the brain to signal a need for an increase in food intake. Likewise, several substances have been identified that signal the brain to decrease food intake.
