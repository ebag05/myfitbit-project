        <p>In New York City, obesity is epidemic: more than half of adult New Yorkers are overweight (34%) or obese (22%).  Data show that obesity begins early in life: nearly half of all elementary school children and Head Start children are not a healthy weight.  In New York City, 1 in 5 kindergarten students, and 1 in 4 Head Start children, is obese.

        People (adults and children) who are overweight are at increased risk for diabetes heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis, and cancer.</p>

        <p>In order to become a "Fit Bit" or reclaim the "Fit Bit" you had, a couple of things need to occur.  You to have eat the right foods, exercise and get proper rest in order to recharge and have the energy and motivation you need to make the changes yuo want to see in yourself.</p>
      
        <p>Physical activity improves mood and health, even if you don't lose weight immediately.  Get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week,
            such as brisk walking or biking.  Just walking burns calories, improves heart health and strengthens muscles.</p>
      
        <p>In addition to things mentioned above, you need 1 other thing: information.  Accurate information helps by guding you on when and how to exercise properly as well as what things to eat and drink that will help you shed the pounds and keep them off.</p>
        
        <p>Below is a list - not all inclusive - of where to exercise at, make connections with like-minded people and online resources to be used as guides.</p>
