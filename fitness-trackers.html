        <p>In New York City, obesity is epidemic: more than half of adult New Yorkers are overweight (34%) or obese (22%).  Data show that obesity begins early in life: nearly half of all elementary school children and Head Start children are not a healthy weight.  In New York City, 1 in 5 kindergarten students, and 1 in 4 Head Start children, is obese.

        People (adults and children) who are overweight are at increased risk for diabetes heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis, and cancer.</p>

        <p>For those interested in its history, Harlem might be explored by inspecting its religious edifices (like the Abyssinian Baptist Church), elegant row houses that rival the brownstones of Brooklyn Heights and attractive parks (landmarks like Hamilton Grange and the Mount Morris Fire Watchtower can be found in St. Nicholas and Marcus Garvey Parks, respectively; note that the Fire Watchtower in Marcus Garvey Park is currently being restored). But there's much to admire about Harlem's present, too. The neighborhood has seen an influx of new shops, music halls and restaurants, including the acclaimed Red Rooster Harlem, from celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, and The Cecil, Esquire magazine's 2014 pick for best new restaurant in America. The links below will help guide you along Harlem's past and future.</p>
